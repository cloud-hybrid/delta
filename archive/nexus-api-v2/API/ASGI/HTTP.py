    Successful HTTP Responses

    Properties::
        Success.Ok (int): The request has succeeded. The meaning of the success depends
            on the HTTP method.
            - GET: The resource has been fetched and is transmitted in the message body.
            - HEAD: The entity headers are in the message body.
            - PUT or POST: The resource describing the result of the action is transmitted
              in the message body.
            - TRACE: The message body contains the request message as received by the server.
        Success.Created (int): Created
            The request has succeeded and a new resource has been created as a result.
            This is typically the response sent after POST requests, or some PUT requests.
        Success.Accepted (int): Accepted
            The request has been received but not yet acted upon. It is noncommittal,
            since there is no way in HTTP to later send an asynchronous response indicating
            the outcome of the request. It is intended for cases where another process or
            server handles the request, or for batch processing.
        Success.Information (int): Non-Authoritative Information
            This response code means the returned meta-information is not exactly the same
            as is available from the origin server, but is collected from a local or a
            third-party copy. This is mostly used for mirrors or backups of another resource.
            Except for that specific case, the "200 OK" response is preferred to this status.
        Success.Empty (int): No Content
            There is no content to send for this request, but the headers may be useful. The
            user-agent may update its cached headers for this resource with the new ones.
        Success.Reset (int): Reset Content
            Tells the user-agent to reset the document which sent this request.
        Success.Partial (int): Partial Content
            This response code is used when the Range header is sent from the client to request
            only part of a resource.
        Success.Multi (int): Multi-Status (WebDAV)
            Conveys information about multiple resources, for situations where multiple status
             codes might be appropriate.
        Success.Enumerated (int): Already Reported (WebDAV)
            Used inside a <dav:propstat> response element to avoid repeatedly enumerating the
            internal members of multiple bindings to the same collection.
        Success.Issued (int): IM Used (HTTP Delta encoding)
            The server has fulfilled a GET request for the resource, and the response is a
            representation of the result of one or more instance-manipulations applied to
            the current instance.
